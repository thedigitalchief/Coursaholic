# AutomaticCourseRegistration
This is a python terminal based automatic course registration script.
The course registration pattern is based on VIT's FFCS portal.

USAGE:
In the initial commit, the requested list of courses aka Wishlist is hardcoded. 
Modify the variable to add/remove courses and run a3.py.
The csv dataset will be updated accordingly and the registered courses will be saved in a html file
