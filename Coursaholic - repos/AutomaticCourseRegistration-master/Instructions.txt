Given a dictionary of Wishlist, the python code automatically registers the courses.

Execution Procedure :
1) Save all the files in a folder and load in python environment
2) Update the dictionary Wishlist if you want to register different courses
3) run a3.py
4) The code returns the steps taken to register the course and the registered courses with the number of credits
5) On requesting input, enter 'y' to update the databases after registering the courses
6) Open the file registered.html to view the registered courses in a table
